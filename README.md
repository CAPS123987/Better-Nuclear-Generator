## How to setup

First you need place reactor core

This will show "hologram" how to build reactor

Also you can click status button to show "hologram" again

Every part of reactor has what color belongs to it in description

When reactor is built, it should show on status button that the reactor is built

Well done! you built reactor

## How to operate

### Menu

To generate electricity you need to have stable heat - that means heat around 5500Â°C 

You can regulate heat by increasing/decreasing coolant pre tick and uran per 500s

You can inspect current status by hovering over flint and steel in center of screen

When you put uran in it **AUTOMATICALLY start reaction even if it doesn't have coolant**

When reaction is running it gets coolant from internal buffer, internal buffer is filling from input slots in reactor core, input slots are filling from blue wool/reactor input same goes with uran

When reaction is running it puts waste in the form of heated coolant, that goes in red wool/reactor output- if slot with waste is full reactor explodes

When reaction is done it puts waste in the form of plutonium that goes in red wool/reactor output- if slot with waste is full reactor explodes

### When the explosion occurs

-When waste slot is full

-When heat is too high

-When not enought coolant
